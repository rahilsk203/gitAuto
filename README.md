## Overview

gitAuto is a powerful Node.js CLI tool that simplifies GitHub repository management by automating common Git and GitHub operations. Whether you're creating new repositories, managing branches, or syncing changes, gitAuto streamlines the entire workflow directly from your terminal.

## Features

- **Repository Management**: Create, clone, and delete repositories
- **Automated Git Operations**: Push, pull, and sync with a single command
- **Smart Suggestions**: Get intelligent recommendations based on your repository state
- **Performance Optimizations**: DSA-level optimizations for faster execution
- **Batch Operations**: Process multiple repositories simultaneously
- **Analytics Dashboard**: View repository statistics and metrics
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track execution times and optimize workflows
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: 100+ specific error scenarios with detailed guidance
- **Automatic Conflict Resolution**: Automatically resolve non-fast-forward push rejections

## Why gitAuto?

Traditional Git workflows often involve multiple manual steps:
1. Manually creating repositories on GitHub
2. Setting up local repositories
3. Configuring Git credentials
4. Managing branches through complex commands
5. Remembering various Git commands

gitAuto eliminates these pain points by:
- Automating repository setup and configuration
- Providing an intuitive menu-driven interface
- Offering smart suggestions based on your repository state
- Handling authentication seamlessly
- Reducing repetitive tasks to single commands

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v12 or higher
- **Git** (any recent version)
- **GitHub Account** (free or paid)
- **Internet Connection** for GitHub API access

## Installation

### Using npm (Recommended)

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @rahilsk/gitauto

# Verify installation
gitauto --version
```

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rahilsk203/gitAuto.git
cd gitAuto

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run directly
node index.js
```

## Getting Started

### First Run Experience

When you run `gitauto` for the first time, the tool will:

1. **Check System Requirements**
   - Verify Node.js, Git, and GitHub CLI installation
   - Automatically install missing tools when possible

2. **Configure Git Settings**
   - Set username to your system username
   - Set email to `username@users.noreply.github.com`

3. **Authenticate with GitHub**
   - Automatically initiate GitHub CLI authentication
   - Open browser for seamless login

4. **Present Main Menu**
   - Show context-aware options based on current directory

### Authentication

gitAuto uses GitHub CLI for secure authentication:
- No need to manually manage personal access tokens
- Browser-based authentication for security
- Automatic token management through GitHub CLI
- Reuses existing authentication if already logged in

## Usage Guide

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run from any directory
gitauto
```

### Context-Aware Interface

gitAuto automatically adapts its interface based on your current location:

**In a Git Repository Directory:**
- Repository-specific operations (push, pull, branch management)
- Status and history viewing
- Analytics dashboard

**Outside a Git Repository:**
- Repository creation
- Cloning existing repositories
- General operations

### Smart Workflow

1. **Repository Creation**
   ```bash
   gitauto
   # Select "Create Repository"
   # Enter name and privacy settings
   # Repository is created and cloned automatically
   ```

2. **Daily Development**
   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   gitauto
   # View smart suggestions
   # Commit and push changes
   # Manage branches
   ```

## Smart Features

### 📊 Repository Analytics Dashboard

Get insights into your repository:
- **Commit Count**: Total commits in the repository
- **Branch Count**: Number of local branches
- **File Count**: Total tracked files
- **Contributor Count**: Number of contributors

### 💡 Smart Suggestions

Context-aware recommendations based on repository state:
- **Uncommitted Changes**: "You have uncommitted changes. Consider committing them."
- **Ahead of Remote**: "Your branch is X commit(s) ahead of remote. Consider pushing your changes."
- **Behind Remote**: "Your branch is X commit(s) behind remote. Consider pulling the latest changes."

## Performance Optimizations

gitAuto implements several DSA-level optimizations to ensure maximum performance:

### ⚡ Caching Strategies
- **Analytics Caching**: Repository analytics are cached for 30 seconds to avoid repeated expensive Git operations
- **Suggestions Caching**: Smart suggestions are cached for 10 seconds for faster response times
- **API Response Caching**: GitHub API responses are cached with intelligent expiration

### 🚀 Parallel Execution
- **Concurrent Git Operations**: Multiple Git commands are executed in parallel when possible
- **Batch Command Processing**: Related commands are combined to reduce subprocess overhead
- **Multi-Repository Operations**: Perform the same operation across multiple repositories simultaneously

### 📈 Performance Monitoring
- **Execution Time Tracking**: All operations are monitored for performance metrics
- **Performance Dashboard**: View detailed performance statistics for all operations
- **Resource Optimization**: Continuous optimization based on performance data

### 🧠 Intelligent Algorithms
- **Efficient Data Structures**: Uses Maps for O(1) cache lookups
- **Lazy Loading**: Data is only fetched when needed
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cache cleanup to prevent memory leaks

## Intelligent Error Handling

gitAuto provides enhanced error handling with user-friendly guidance:

### 🎯 Context-Aware Error Messages
- Clear, descriptive error messages instead of cryptic failures
- Specific guidance based on the type of error encountered
- Detailed information to help with troubleshooting

### 💡 Smart Suggestions
- **Add Failures**: Guidance on checking file status and .gitignore configuration
- **Commit Failures**: Suggestions for staging changes and valid commit messages
- **Push Failures**: Help with permissions, network issues, and authentication
- **Pull Failures**: Conflict resolution steps and repository access troubleshooting
- **General Issues**: Internet connectivity checks and GitHub status monitoring

### 🤝 Interactive User Prompts
- When operations fail, users are prompted to continue or cancel
- Decision points allow users to choose their preferred course of action
- Guidance is provided at each step to help resolve issues

### 🔧 Detailed Troubleshooting
- Specific error details when available (stderr output)

### Automatic Conflict Resolution

gitAuto now includes automatic conflict resolution for non-fast-forward push rejections:

When you encounter a non-fast-forward push rejection, gitAuto will:
1. Automatically detect the conflict
2. Prompt you to automatically resolve by pulling changes first
3. Pull the latest changes from the remote repository
4. Attempt to push again after resolving the conflict
5. If still unsuccessful, offer a safe force push option (`--force-with-lease`)

This feature eliminates the need to manually run `git pull` and then `git push`, streamlining your workflow and reducing the chance of errors.
